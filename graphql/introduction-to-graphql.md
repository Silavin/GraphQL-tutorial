# Introduction to GraphQL

## History

 GraphQL was developed internally by Facebook in 2012 before being publicly released in 2015 \(open-sourced\).

It's creation was largely incentivized by the world wide increase in mobile usage along with the slow increase in performance of networks in developing countries. Facebook, wishing to build a foothold in these emerging markets made GraphQL. It provides a more efficient method of sending data from the servers, which their competitors at the time, did not have the ability to contest with.

Now, GraphQL has gained even more popularity due to its flexibility and efficiency. With the huge boom in demand for web based applications, more complex APIs will be built. For such architecture, frequent iterations would be needed, which are hard to do when using REST.
