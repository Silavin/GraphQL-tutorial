# Overview

![An overview of how GraphQL works](../.gitbook/assets/graphql-overview.png)

This diagram will make little sense to you now but do keep it in mind as we go through this course.

For now, you can treat the Schema as displayed in the diagram as the equivalent of an endpoint in a REST API, while the object types as the data passed into those said endpoint. 

Do note that they are similar but far from being the same.
